<h1>Week two news!</h1>
<h2>The Manor Mavericks defeat the Lorenzen Lightning 39-29!</h2>
<p>The Manor Mavericks improved to 2-0 this weekend thanks to a stellar performance from Peter Radovich. He had 18 of the team's 39 points. A fifth round pick, he is loooking like a steal for Coach Michael Weston.</p>
<h2>The Weaver Warriors defeat the Village Vipers 35-34! </h2>
<p>The Warriors are now 2-0 after surviving a tight game with the Vipers. Julian Epstein's 13 points made the difference for them. The Vipers will be frustrated with the result, as they missed a few key opportunites late in the game. With a couple of missed layups and a poor timeout called by Coach Lucas Ierodiaconou, the Vipers will be itching to get their first win on the board.</p>
<h2>Orienta Orioles topple Stuyvesant Slingers 60-54!</h2>
<p>A statistical improbability has happened in LBL, with their being 3 2-0 teams and 3 0-2 teams after the first two weeks. This was the highest scoring game of the season so far. Both teams play a high tempo, high 3 point shooting offense. Aidan Roy showed why he was MVP last year with 27 points.</p>
